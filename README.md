# p-adic cellular neural networks: Applications to image processing
The p-adic cellular neural networks (CNNs) are mathematical generalizations of the neural networks introduced by Chua and Yang in the 80s. In this work we present two new types of p-adic CNNs that can perform computations with real data, and whose dynamics can be understood almost completely. The first type of networks are edge detectors for grayscale images. The stationary states of these networks are organized hierarchically in a lattice structure. The dynamics of any of these networks consists of transitions toward some minimal state in the lattice. The second type is a new class of reaction–diffusion networks. We investigate the stability of these networks and show that they can be used as filters to reduce noise, preserving the edges, in grayscale images polluted with additive Gaussian noise. The networks introduced here were found experimentally. They are abstract evolution equations on spaces of real-valued functions defined in the p-adic unit ball for some prime number p. In practical applications the prime p is determined by the size of image, and thus, only small primes are used. We provide several numerical simulations showing how these networks work.

# p‑adic Cellular Neural Networks
In this article we introduce the p-adic cellular neural networks which are mathematical generalizations of the classical cellular neural networks (CNNs) introduced by Chua and Yang. The new networks have infinitely many cells which are organized hierarchically in rooted trees, and also they have infinitely many hidden layers. Intuitively, the p-adic CNNs occur as limits of large hierarchical discrete CNNs. More precisely, the new networks can be very well approximated by hierarchical discrete CNNs. Mathematically speaking, each of the new networks is modeled by one integro-differential equation depending on several p-adic spatial variables and the time. We study the Cauchy problem associated to these integro-differential equations and also provide numerical methods for solving them.
